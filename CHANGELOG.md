## [5.0.0](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-net/compare/4.8.0...5.0.0) (2022-02-28)


### Features

- In v5.0.0, [we have refactored the library](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-net/pull/67) to be more maintainable in the future.
Most importantly, we got rid of some complex internal logic (such as tricky json serialization and deserialization, code organization improvements etc.).
Also, we made the library more modern such as adding `Async` postfix to async methods. All public
methods have documentation now and a link to the official docs now. This README file's code snippets are updated to reflect the new changes.

### ðŸš¨ Breaking changes:
- All async methods have `Async` postfix.
- Model classes have been moved into `Stream.Models` namespace.
- All client classes have interfaces now, and `Ref()` methods are not static anymore. This will make it easier to the consumers of this library to unit test them.
